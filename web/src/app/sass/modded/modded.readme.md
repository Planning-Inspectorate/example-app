# Overriding govuk styles 

Sometimes govuk components are not quite right for our needs and we have to change how they look. In those situations we can overwrite how they look by adding a meaningful class to the component, like we did with the header component in this app. 

In `web/src/app/sass/modded/govuk-header.scss` we overwrite default `.govuk-header` style to remove it's border.
